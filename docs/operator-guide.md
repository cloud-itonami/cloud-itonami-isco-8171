# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's plant roster and operator-certification/registration process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for logged production-run/batch/progress records.
3. Run synthetic coordination cases (production-run/batch/progress record logging, scheduling, safety-concern flags, supply orders).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions — every safety-concern flag, no exceptions ever, and every above-threshold supply order.
5. Measure coordination outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (process-anomaly, chemical-exposure and equipment-condition concerns ALWAYS reach a human — no exceptions, ever)
- provenance for all plants and operators before any coordination action
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions

## Scope Boundary (Mandatory)

This actor coordinates pulp-and-papermaking-plant scheduling and
logistics ONLY. Operators must not wire this actor's output into any
system that would let it directly finalize a plant-operation-execution
decision, finalize a plant-safety-clearance decision, or override a
plant safety officer's judgment — the governor's closed op-allowlist
and scope-exclusion rule are the last line of defense, not the only
one; operator-side integrations must not create a path around them.
This actor never operates pulp-digestion or paper-forming plant
equipment itself: `:coordinate-supply-order` covers plant-equipment/
administrative-supply procurement only, never pulping chemicals
themselves — chemical handling is entirely out of scope for this
administrative-coordination actor.

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans unconditionally, and that no integration allows this actor to
finalize a plant-operation-execution decision, finalize a plant-
safety-clearance decision, or override plant-safety-officer authority.
