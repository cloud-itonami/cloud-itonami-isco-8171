  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 8171 Pulp and Papermaking Plant Operators
  pulp-and-papermaking-plant scheduling/logistics coordination actor
  (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section;
  README's 'Robotics premise' — a pulp-and-papermaking-plant
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot proposes crew/shift
  scheduling, production-run/batch/progress record logging,
  safety-concern flags and administrative/equipment supply order
  coordination under this advisor/governor pair, which never
  dispatches hardware itself, never operates pulp-digestion or
  paper-forming plant equipment, and never finalizes a plant-
  operation-execution decision, a plant-safety-clearance decision, or
  overrides a plant safety officer's judgment). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-8131's chemcoord.store.

  Domain:

    plant    — a registered pulp and papermaking plant/production
               line under coordination (:plant-id, :name, :location).
    operator — a registered certified pulp-and-papermaking-plant
               operator {:operator-id :plant-id :name :role},
               belonging to exactly one registered plant (the plant
               currently assigned to this operator for this
               operation).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged production-run/
               batch/progress record, scheduling proposal, safety-
               concern flag or supply-order coordination entry) —
               written ONLY via commit-record!. This actor coordinates
               pulp-and-papermaking-plant scheduling/logistics ONLY —
               a `record` is a coordination artifact, never a
               plant-operation-execution decision, a plant-safety-
               clearance decision, or a plant safety officer's-
               judgment override.
