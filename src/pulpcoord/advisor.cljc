  "Pulp & Papermaking Plant Scheduling & Logistics Coordination Advisor
  — the advisor named in this repository's README, proposing a pulp-
  and-papermaking-plant scheduling/logistics coordination operation
  (log a production-run/batch/progress record, schedule a crew/shift
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a supply order) from a
  plant roster, operator roster and plant schedule. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `pulpcoord.governor` checks
  plant/operator registration, the closed op-allowlist and scope-
  exclusion independently, and always escalates safety-concern flags,
  above-threshold supply orders and low-confidence proposals. This
  actor coordinates PULP-AND-PAPERMAKING-PLANT SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS
  ONLY — it never operates pulp-digestion or paper-forming plant
  equipment itself and never proposes to finalize a plant-operation-
  execution decision, finalize a plant-safety-clearance decision, or
  override a plant safety officer's judgment. Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-8131's chemcoord.advisor.

   registration and scope independently. Safety-concern flags (process
